            <p>
                Games JS is an open marketplace for independent digital creators with a focus on independent video games. It’s a platform that enables anyone to sell the content they've created. As a seller you’re in charge of how it’s done: you set the price, you run sales, and you design your pages. It’s never necessary to get votes, likes, or follows to get your content approved, and you can make changes to how you distribute your work as frequently as you like.
            </p>
            <p>
                Games JS is also a collection of some of the most unique, interesting, and independent creations you'll find on the web. We're not your typical digital storefront, with a wide range of both paid and free content, we encourage you to look around and see what you find.

                Games JS gives creators the tools to make smart choices about how they distribute their content. Creators have access to detailed analytics and about how people discover, download, or play what they've created. Our creator dashboard gives easy access to data about what uploads resonate the most or what links drive the most attention.

Our strong emphasis on empowering creators show in how build itch.io:

We do not believe in exploiting content. Creators should be proud of the pages that display their work. They should never contain advertisements, distracting banners, or links they didn’t approve of.

We believe in making it easy for creators to collect money for their creations in a non-obtrusive way. No matter how large or small the project, it should be simple for fans to donate or pay what they think is fair.

Every creator is unique, so we support a wide range of methods to help them make a living. All purchases and donations on itch.io are pay-what-you-want above the minimum. The minimum price can be set to zero: it’s free, but fans can choose to support the creator if they like what they're offering. itch.io supports pre-orders, selling rewards, creating early-access content, bundling your content, and even doing crowdfunding with project goals.
